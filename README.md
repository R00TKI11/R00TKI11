# 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos

I’m a **senior software engineering leader** with over a decade of experience building and operating enterprise-scale platforms in regulated and mission-critical environments.

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering leadership, platform strategy, and execution**, with a strong focus on enabling teams to deliver reliable software at scale. I’ve led multi-team engineering efforts, owned long-lived platform roadmaps, and partnered with stakeholders across the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

I’m most effective in environments that value **clear thinking, pragmatic decision-making, and long-term sustainability** over short-term novelty.

## What I focus on ⚙️

- **Engineering leadership at scale**  
  Leading teams, setting direction, and making trade-offs that balance delivery, quality, security, and cost.

- **Platform and DevOps strategy**  
  Designing shared platforms that enable many teams to move faster while remaining reliable and operable.

- **Distributed and international collaboration**  
  Working across time zones and organizations, with experience supporting globally distributed engineering teams.

- **Execution in complex environments**  
  Translating high-level goals into practical systems and processes where reliability and accountability matter.

## Selected projects 📌

### BoltGuard
A fast, offline-first container policy engine designed for developer workflows and constrained environments.

Focus:
- Policy evaluation and secure-by-default workflows  
- Practical tooling for air-gapped or restricted systems  

Why it matters: security and platform tooling needs to work in real operational environments, not just ideal ones.

---

### jobHunter (private, in progress)
A personal tool to help identify and prioritize senior roles that are genuinely worth applying to.

Focus:
- Job ingestion and scoring  
- Workflow tooling and decision support  
- Human-in-the-loop review and outcome tracking  

Why it matters: applying to fewer, higher-quality roles with better signal and less wasted effort.

---

### AI learning portfolio
A structured workspace for exploring applied AI and ML concepts through hands-on experimentation.

Focus:
- Applied learning, not hype  
- Understanding limits, trade-offs, and real-world behavior  

Why it matters: I value adaptability and learning velocity, especially as new tools become part of everyday engineering work.

## Applied AI, as a supporting skill 🧠

Alongside my leadership work, I actively explore **AI and ML as practical tools**.

I use AI to:
- Accelerate development and prototyping  
- Build internal tooling and workflow automation  
- Explore how AI can responsibly augment engineering teams  

This work is intentionally applied-first. It complements my engineering background rather than replacing it.

## Technologies and context

- Languages: Python, Java, C#, TypeScript, SQL, Go  
- Domains: platform engineering, DevSecOps, distributed systems  
- Operating environments: regulated systems, reliability-focused delivery

## A bit more about me 🌍

- Based in the US, open to **UK or EU relocation** with sponsorship  
- Fluent in **English and Spanish**  
- Comfortable with international collaboration and travel  
- Volunteer mentor and coding competition problem lead

### How to read this profile

If you’re reviewing my GitHub:
- Start with projects that show **architecture, structure, and decision-making**  
- Treat AI-heavy repos as evidence of adaptability and learning, not a career pivot  
- Expect documentation that explains *why* things exist, not just *what* they do
