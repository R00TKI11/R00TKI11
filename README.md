## 🧠 About Me

I’m an engineering leader with 12+ years of experience delivering secure, mission-critical software across defense, logistics, maintenance, and large operational environments.

My background spans:

- Leading 10–17 person engineering teams  
- DevSecOps & cloud-native automation  
- Full-stack engineering across Java, C#, and Python  
- Modernizing legacy ecosystems through microservices, containers, & CI/CD  
- Product ownership, roadmap creation, and stakeholder management  
- Enabling high-availability platforms (up to 99.9% uptime)  
- Driving digital transformation & enterprise architecture initiatives  

🌱 **Today, I’m expanding my focus into AI/ML**, building a portfolio of high-quality, applied AI projects, and preparing research for a competitive graduate program in machine learning.  

I am particularly interested in:

- LLM agents for developer productivity and operations  
- RAG systems for technical knowledge bases  
- ML models for predictive maintenance and decision-making  
- Local inference and small language model optimization  
- Evaluation and benchmarking of AI coding assistants
